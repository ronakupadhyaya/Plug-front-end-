## Plug

To run the app, run this command:  
```
npm install  
npm run dev  
```
Wait for the webpack to fully start if nothing shows up. Refresh once completed and you should see results. 

# Overview
The current environment polarizes between personal users & content creators. The dichotomy makes it hard to sift through noise & find people to create with. Plug is a collaborative platform for the profusion of nouveaux content creators born on Youtube, IG, & other media outlets
